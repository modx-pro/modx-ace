Integrates Ace Code Editor into MODX Revolution.

Building the package
-------------------
Run _build/build.transport.php from the component root (e.g. in browser or CLI with MODX_BASE_PATH set). The script works with both MODX 2 and MODX 3. If you need to install the resulting package on MODX 2, you can either build from a MODX 2 installation (set MODX_BASE_PATH to your MODX 2 root) so the transport uses MODX 2 vehicle class names, or build from MODX 3 — the build script then patches the zip for MODX 2 compatibility.
